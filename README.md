## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the kinematic control of a 6-degree-of-freedom UR10e robotic arm to track and catch a moving sphere using MATLAB.

### Part A: Tracking the Sphere
- Developed a control signal to follow a moving sphere with a desired relative position and orientation.
- Simulated the control system in MATLAB, achieving convergence to the target position with velocity and acceleration constraints.

### Part B: Catching the Sphere
- Attached a gripper to the robotic arm to catch the moving sphere.
- Designed control algorithms for precise approach and capture while maintaining orientation and avoiding collisions.

## Results

- **Part A:** Successful tracking of the moving sphere, achieving the desired position and orientation.
- **Part B:** Accurate approach and capture of the sphere with the robotic arm, ensuring safe operation within speed and acceleration limits.

## Technologies Used

- **Languages:** MATLAB  
- **Tools:** Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB  
- **Hardware Simulated:** UR10e Robotic Arm, Gripper  

## How to Run

Run `partA.m` and `partB.m` in MATLAB to visualize the simulations.
